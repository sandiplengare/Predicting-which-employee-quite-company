**Project Description:**

The "Which Employee Will Quit Your Company" project is designed to address the critical challenge of employee retention in organizations. 
Leveraging data analysis and predictive modeling, this project aims to identify factors and patterns that indicate which employees are at a higher risk of leaving the company. 
By examining employee characteristics, performance metrics, job satisfaction, and other relevant factors, 
the project assists HR professionals and management in making informed decisions to proactively retain valuable talent, reduce turnover, and create a more stable and productive work environment. 
This predictive tool empowers organizations to take preemptive actions, such as targeted retention strategies and employee engagement initiatives, 
to mitigate employee attrition and enhance overall workforce management.
